Language Arts is a vast topic with many outcomes.  Instead of providing links to each outcome, I have provided a list of websites that address a variety of these outcomes.  It is important to take the time to read with your child and to ask them questions about what he or she has read.  Also, instead of having your child tell you how their day was, ask them to write you a note about their day.  Have them read the note aloud to you and work with them on improving their writing.
