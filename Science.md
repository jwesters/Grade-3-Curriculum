2. Given a description of the properties of a particular rock or mineral, identify a sample rock or mineral that matches those properties. Properties that  
students should be able to describe and interpret include:

• lustre or “shininess”; e.g., shiny, dull, glassy, metallic, earthy  
• texture; e.g., rough, smooth, uneven  
• hardness, based on scratch tests with available materials  
• presence of carbonates. Note that the presence of carbonates can be tested with vinegar or another mild acid  
• crystal shape for minerals, or overall pattern of rocks

3. Describe and classify a group of rocks and minerals, based upon the above properties. [Link 1](http://viewpure.com/-50WF5LHuH0?start=0&end=0)

4. Recognize that rocks are composed of a variety of materials; and given a course-grained rock and magnifier, describe some of the component materials.

5. Recognize and describe the various components within a sample of soil; e.g., clay, sand, pebbles, decaying plants; and describe differences between two different soil samples. – [Link 1](http://viewpure.com/uS7zfeK4OTQ?start=16&end=0)

6. Describe ways in which rocks break down to become soil, and demonstrate one or more of these ways; e.g., by shaking a group of small, soft rocks in a jar of water; by striking rocks together.  
Note: Safety goggles should be used. [Link 1](http://viewpure.com/YNpogtS1rB0?start=0&end=0)

7. Describe some common uses of rocks and minerals; and identify examples of those uses within the school, home or local community.

# Building with a Variety of Materials

---

**General Learner Expectations**  
_**Students will:**_  
_**3–6 Use, safely, a variety of tools, techniques and materials in construction activities.**_  
_**3–7 Construct structures, using a variety of materials and designs, and compare the effectiveness of the various materials and designs for their intended purposes**_

**Specific Learner Expectations**  
Students will:  
1. Using a variety of materials and techniques, design,  construct and test structures that are intended to:  
• support objects  
• span gaps  
• serve as containers  
• serve as models of particular living things, objects or  buildings. – [Link 1](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/build-bridge-p1.html)

2. Select appropriate materials for use in construction  tasks, and explain the choice of materials. Students  should demonstrate familiarity with a variety of  materials, such as papers, woods, plastics, clay and metals.

3. Select tools that are suitable to particular tasks and  materials, and use them safely and effectively.

4. Understand and use a variety of methods to join or  fasten materials.

5. Identify the intended purpose and use of structures to be built, and explain how knowing the intended purpose and use helps guide decisions regarding materials and design.

6. Understand that simple designs are often as effective as more complex ones, as well as being easier and cheaper to build, and illustrate this understanding with a practical example.

7. Recognize the importance of good workmanship, and demonstrate growth toward good workmanship.

8. Maintain and store materials and tools safely and properly.

9. Apply skills of listening, speaking and cooperative decision making in working with other students on a construction project

# Testing Materials and Designs

---

**General Learner Expectations**  
_**Students will:**_  
_**3–8 Evaluate the suitability of different**_ _**materials and designs for their use in a**_ _**building task.**_

**Specific Learner Expectations**  
Students will:  
1. Recognize that functional structures must be sufficiently strong and stable and that unstable or weak structures are often unsafe to use.

2. Compare and evaluate the strength and stability of different models or objects constructed.

3. Describe the distinctive properties of some common solids, such as wood, paper or plastic, that make them suitable for use as building materials.

4. Apply procedures to test the strength of construction materials, in particular, different stocks of papers, plastics or wood.

5. Apply procedures to test different designs.

6. Apply procedures to test the strength of different methods of joining.

7. Identify and apply methods for making a structure stronger and more stable; e.g., by adding or joining parts to form triangles.

# Hearing and Sound

---

**General Learner Expectations**  
_**Students will:**_  
_**3–9 Describe the nature of sound, and demonstrate methods for producing and controlling sound.**_

**Specific Learner Expectations**  
Students will:  
1. Identify examples of vibration.

2. Recognize that sound is the result of vibration; and demonstrate that the larger the vibration, the louder the sound.

3. Recognize that there are ways of measuring the loudness of sounds and that loud sounds pose a danger to the ear. [Link 1](http://www.childrensuniversity.manchester.ac.uk/interactives/science/brainandsenses/ear/)

4. Recognize that pitch is the result of differences in the rate of vibration, and predict how a change in the rate of vibration will affect a sound. [Link 1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/scienceclips/ages/9_10/changing_sounds.shtml)

5. Demonstrate a variety of ways of producing sounds; e.g., by striking an empty glass, by blowing air into a bottle, by constructing and using a device that involves vibrating strings.

6. Use sound-producing devices that the student has constructed to demonstrate methods for controlling the loudness, pitch and quality of sound produced.

7. Identify examples that show that sound can travel through a variety of materials, including solids, liquids and air, and that sound travels in all directions

# Animal Life Cycles

---

**General Learner Expectations**  
_**Students will:**_
